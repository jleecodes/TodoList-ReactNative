# TodoList-ReactNative
A Todo-List created using React Native following a tutorial
Key Learnings
1) Set up dependencies
2) Create frontends
3) Pass props
4) Manage state

How to Setup
1) npm install --global expo-cli (this installs Expo)
2) expo init todoList (creates the mobile application, press enter on blank template to start with a blank canvas)
3) cd todoList (changes into the todoList directory)
4) expo init (initializes the app with expo)

How to View
Download the Expo application on your phone to see your application live as you are coding.
After doing all of this, if you type in your command line 'expo start', a localhost webpage will show up and you can scan the QR code using the Expo application from your phone.
(If you are on Mac, you can press 'i' after running 'expo start' to run an iOS simulator)
